# Comission

## Skill requirement

Most likely XML and C#

## Mod description

An advanced ritual that makes a pawn inhumanized without needing the inhumanization precept. Low quality rituals should cause the pawn to either fall into a dark psychic coma for a few days or trigger the humanity break mental state. I feel like the cost should be rather expensive since it will make inhumanization almost freely available, with the research costing 100 and requiring brain wipe researched as a prerequisite, and maybe 2-3 shards for the ritual cost.

## Budget

Dunno, $40? Negotiable.

## Deadline

Before the heat death of the universe.
